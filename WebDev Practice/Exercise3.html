<!--Online Newspaper
Using HTML 5 only, create a prototype of an online newspaper.
Validate and verify the result on the browser as you proceed. Don’t mind about the visual aspect of the result (that will be taken care by using CSS).
Use the site http://www.lipsum.com/ if you need to generate example paragraphs.
Create separate sections for the header, menu and body of the newspaper. Use semantic tags (section, header, nav, …) for those sections…
The header should have a title (h1), a subtitle (h2) and a logo (img).
The menu should have links to each of the newspaper sections (sports, politics,…) organized using an unordered list (ul). These links can simply point to example URLs.
The newspaper body should have a section for each news item. Use the semantic tag article.
A news item should have a title (h3), an introduction (p) and an image (img). It should also have a footer containing the author name and date.
Don’t forget to validate the page when you’re done.-->

                                    <p class="fullPar">Ghosts as an overall category are both fascinating and terrifying to the average person. There are many different types 
                                        and temperaments within the broad category of ghosts, though all have their place in the supernatural realm and lore of various human cultures.
                                        It is often-times argued that the manner in which the living being passed to the spiritual plane dictates both if their soul becomes a 
                                        ghost, and the methods they interact with their surroundings. Many cultures to this day have reverence for these souls, while others maintain
                                        a distinct fear, but the frequency legends and tales surrounding ghosts exist indicate there is more than meets the eye. <br>

                                        pirates! Although there has been centuries of folktales and fictional stories, mudding the waters, surrounding these outlaws, few
                                        do justice to the true tales. From the betrayal and resurgence of Henry Avery, to the womanizing and terror of Edward Thatch, to
                                        the household name Henry Morgan, to the flamboyant and audacious Jack Rackham, the good the bad and the ugly characters who partook
                                        in this lifestyle simply cannot be captured in any single account. Some view them as truly free and equal, some see them as scoundrels 
                                        and thieves, but most acknowledge they were globally pivotal in more than one historical period.<br>
