	<img align="middle" src="Killer beast of Caerbannor.jpg" alt="The Killer Beast itself, to horrid and foul to describe in words">
	<h2 style="color:red;text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Why should you fear this foul creature?</h2>
	<h3 style="color:red;font-size:150%;"> >Even King Arthur Struggled</h3>
	<p style="color:#b41010;font-size:150%"> King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table (the most valiant warriors in all of Great Britain) struggled to slay the beast.<br>
		Even though they were on a holy quest from God and equiped for combat, they still lost many a good man to this horrid beast.<br>
		Eventually they only triumphed with the use of Holy High Explosives... (statistically you don't have a class 3 explosives license so good luck ;)!)

	<h3 style="color:red;font-size:150%;"> >Tim Already Told You Not To</h3>
	<p style="color:#b41010;font-size:150%"> The mighty and powerful sorcerer Tim the Enchanter advises against it.<br>
		He is smarter than even Arthur, King of the Britains.<br>
		He can literally shoot fire at will and still won't fight the Killer Rabbit!

	<h3 style="color:red;font-size:150%;"> >Traits of the Beast Itself</h3>
	<p style="color:#b41010;font-size:150%"> If you weren't listening when Tim told you, I'll reitterate.<br>
		It has big nasty teeth! (Razor sharp)<br>
		It has a mean streak a mile wide! (~1.6km)<br>
		Its has already killed hundreds of men! (You would be one of them)
