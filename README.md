# BasicWebDevelopment
Projects to software development and web-dev conducted through MSSA.
These projects and exercises were designed to help us get comfortable and familiar with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. I took many creative liberties with them
and had a lot of fun creating these pages with my own personal flare.
